### Purpose

Pepper has invested significant time and effort in building project data visualizations and sharing them internally. Several operations directors identified a need to share project dashboards with external clients to communicate their projects’ statuses better. We, therefore, created a web application to manage user access to embedded Microsoft Power BI reports.

### Method

We built Pepper360 with ASP.NET Core to seamlessly integrate with other Microsoft services Pepper uses. Pepper360 enables application administrators to manage users and authorize them to view Power BI reports. To do this, we integrated the web application with several adjacent systems:

-   [Microsoft Power BI](https://powerbi.microsoft.com/en-us/): Tool for building and sharing data visualizations
-   [Azure Active Directory](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/active-directory/#overview): Grants the Pepper360 web application permission to access the Power BI reports.
-   [CMiC ERP System](https://cmicglobal.com): Source of each project’s data

### Results

At the time of writing, operations teams have created 50 projects in Pepper360. They use Pepper360 to communicate important information about the project, and the business development team uses Pepper360 to highlight Pepper’s innovative approach to project management.

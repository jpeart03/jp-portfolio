### Purpose

Pepper was looking for a way to understand its operational and financial performance better. Traditionally, Pepper generated tabular, text-based reports and distributed them to relevant decision makers. They recognized an opportunity to use modern visualization tools to analyze their terabytes of data more quickly and accurately.

### Method

We chose to use Microsoft Power BI to build and share operations and financial visualizations within the company. I connected various Power BI reports to different data sources, including relational databases, RESTful APIs, and excel documents hosted in the cloud. I designed the visualizations to match the company’s branding.

### Results

These Power BI reports serve as a real-time, interactive representation of the company’s operational and financial data. They unearthed perviously unseen errors and have driven many of the company’s recent process improvements and data corrections.
